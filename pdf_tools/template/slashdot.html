<h1>John Carmack Slashdot Archive</h1><p></p>
<h2>Overview</h2><p>
	As I refuse to pay $5 just to see Carmack's complete comment history on Slashdot, this list is 
	a touch short (126 out of 142 accounted for). It was generated by searching google 
	for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=Carmack+101025&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=slashdot.org">Carmack 101025 site:slashdot.org</a>, 
	creating a list of unique "article.pl?sid=xx/xx/xx/xxxxxxx" links, wget'ing them all, then parsing through those to grab 
	article titles and comment information.

	A minor flaw of slashdot is that there is no year visible anywhere on the entire site. I feel like I'm lost
	in a bowl of time soup when reading articles and comments, and have trouble putting them in context based
	on their place in history. The trick to getting the year is the in the =sid identifier for articles ( 
	=sid=YY/MM/DD/xxxxxxx ). Fairly annoying, but at least it's available if you know where to look.
