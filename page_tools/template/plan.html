<h1>John Carmack .plan Archive</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
This is a collection of all the .plan files for John Carmack I could manage to scrounge up. Most of them were
parsed out of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050309230054/http://doom-ed.com/blog/category/doom-ed/john-carmack/">doom-ed's</a>
awkwardly unusable archive. Pre-1997 logs were found at the Difference Engine's <a href="http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/quake/info/worklogs.html">Quake page</a> and 
from <a href="http://bluesnews.com/archives/">Blue's News Archives</a>, as all public .plan trackers still in existence don't go back that far.
</p>

<p>A simple parser was run to format them to HTML and extract possible titles from the start of the entry.
The rule is a title was present if there was a single line of text no more than ~90 characters long followed by 2 line feeds. 
A couple posts have either had titles inserted or lines re-arranged to provide an appropriate title, but 90% of them are untouched. 
You can also download the plaintext archives if you would like to do anything with them on your own.
</p>
	
<p>
	There are a few plans that contain code or some other kind of formatted text, which have been embedded in "[code][/code]" 
	tags so the parser can present them properly.
</p>

<p>Note: in his earlier plans, Carmack uses a simple notation scheme to indicate what he has done that day. The
explanation is as follows:</p>

<p class="highlight_block">When I accomplish something, I write a * line that day. <br />
<br />
Whenever a bug / missing feature is mentioned during the day and I don't 
fix it, I make a note of it.  Some things get noted many times before 
they get fixed.<br />
<br />
Occasionally I go back through the old notes and mark with a + the things
I have since fixed. <br />
</p>
	
<p>Later entries may use:</p>
	
<p class="highlight_block">A * entry was completed on that day <br />
A + entry was completed on a later day<br />
A - entry was decided against on a later day.<br />
</p>
